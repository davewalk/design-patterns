# Design Patterns
Samples of design patterns that may be used to quickly scaffold out a web application. Incredibly rough with very little styling or JavaScript and as few dependencies as possible.

Uses [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/) to get a working app up quickly.

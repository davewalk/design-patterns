* Useful for mapping applications that need tools that alter the map
* Allows for new tools to easily be added after application has loaded
* Recommended that a JavaScript framework like Backbone is used to handle toolbar clicks from menu instead of just jQuery
* TODO: Make left bar friendly/collapsible for small-screen devices (smartphones)
